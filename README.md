See preview : http://rezwansaki.github.io/youtube-demo. 


This is my practice file. I try to learn bootstrap 3.2.0.

1. I try to design this site as like YouTube.com
2. It is responsive for desktop, tab and mobile devices
3. Click any youtube video and it play in this site by using a 'Modal' so you stay in here all time. 
4. It is a demo site so functionalities are not worke now.
5. I target to learn design webpage so I don't try with functionary. 

Thanks !!
